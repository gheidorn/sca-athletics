          <h3>SCA Booster Raffle</h3>
          <p>
            The Booster Raffle is a fundraiser that helps supplement the cost of providing sports at St. Catherine's.
            Each family with a child who plays a sport (4th-8th grade) is obligated to join the raffle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each family pays $50 and receives a booklet of tickets. Each ticket is $5 and can be sold to friends or
            family, or simply returned with the family name and phone number on them.
          </p>
          <p>The drawing will be held at the Pigskin Classic on September 23rd!</p>
          <p>Thank you for supporting SCA Athletics!</p>
