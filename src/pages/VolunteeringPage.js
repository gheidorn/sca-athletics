          <h3>Volunteering</h3>
          <p>If any of your children play in a sport, we require you to do a volunteer shift once per season.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fall - Football, Cheerleading, Girls Basketball</li>
            <li>Winter - Girls Volleyball, Boys Basketball</li>
            <li>Spring - Boys Volleyball, Soccer</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is a once-per-family, once-per-season obligation. If you do not meet your volunteer requirement, we
            will cash your volunteering check that is collected with the sport you registered for.
